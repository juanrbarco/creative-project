          <div class='comment'><p>Japanese animated fantasy, Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi?, "Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away") is a 2001 film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and stars Rumi Hiiragi, Miyu Irino, Mari Natsuki, Takeshi Naito, Yasuko Sawaguchi, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Takehiko Ono and Bunta Sugawara. I will use one word to describe it - wonderful! It tells the story of Chihiro Ogino (Hiiragi), a ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighbourhood, enters the spirit world. Stumbling on the food street in that world, her parents are transformed into pigs by the spell of the witch Yubaba (Natsuki), and Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human world. Miyazaki's script was based on associate producer Seiji Okuda's ten-year-old daughter, who came to visit his house each summer. Production of the animated film began in year 2000 with a budget of US$19 million, but during production, Miyazaki realized the film would be over three hours long and decided to cut out several parts of the story. I wish I could see the rest of the story! English version of the film was supervised by the Pixar director John Lasseter, a fan of Miyazaki. Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements. I haven't seen that version, I enjoyed the original with subtitles. Just to say that this is the most successful film in Japanese history, grossing about $270-350 million worldwide. The film even overtook Titanic (at the time the top grossing film worldwide) in the Japanese box office to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a ¥30.4 billion total. Critics just love it, as the audience, and this animated movie is considered one of the best films of the 2000s decade and one of the greatest animated films of all time winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival (tied with Bloody Sunday) and is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. But , even if you are over 14, better now than never! If you want an amazing out-of-this-world story, excellent animation where technology is kept at a level to enhance the story, not to "steal the show", perfect voice acting, meticulous editing, outstanding music... and many more things... please, spend over 2 hours watching this masterpiece!</p></div>

          <div class='comment'><p>Black Box is carried heavily by its audio. Not in the sense of its score, which does heighten the film when utilized, but by its constant analysis of various recordings by its main character. Viewers hear what he hears and we hear it again and again with each alteration. There is almost a shared experience crafted in this utilization of the audio, creating a bordering immersive experience and giving the feeling we too are the detectives. But it is not only the repetition of audio recordings, it is also the inclusion of Mathieu’s uncanny abilities.</p></div>

          <div class='comment'><p>The Devil's Backbone is more sad than frightening. It focuses on the children in an orphanage with nowhere to turn to as the Spanish Civil War soon empties on their doorstep. While the ghost of Santi is truly unnerving, the film reflects a common theme in Guillermo del Toro's films - that humans are the worst kind of monsters.</p></div>

          <div class='comment'><p>The Devil's Backbone is not only one of Guillermo del Toro finest film, but it's one of the best horror movies ever made with an intelligent plot that serves more purpose than to just scare you. The Devil's Backbone follows Carlos, a 12-year-old whose father has died in the Spanish Civil War, arriving at an ominous boy's orphanage where he discovers the school is haunted and has many dark secrets that he must uncover. Unlike most horror movies which solely focuses on a killer or supernatural being, The Devil's Backbone goes beyond the genre conventions and explores acceptance, lust, fear, and surprisingly fits politics in it plot pretty well. It actually delve into these subjects and gives plantation towards them. The great use of metaphors such as the bomb are both brilliant and creative. The film is slow pace, but it works in its favor developing characters worth caring about. It's also unusually complex for a movie of it kind, which once again works in it favors since it's too often horror movies are dead simple. The horror elements on the other hand are not as strong, del Toro reveal the ghost to early and very clearly for us to see eliminating some mystery behind this ghost. The score for this horror is phenomenal, possibly the best score in it genre. The cast themselves can all act, even the kids give out great performances. One standout being Federico Luppi as Dr. Casares is superb, providing us with a true hero, a gentleman of class and compassion. Another memorable performance being Eduardo Noriega who is perfectly cast as the despicable Jacinto, making you despise him more and more as the film progresses. The cinematography is simply amazing, it gritty style helps set the tone for the film in it darkest moments and made great use of it location. The Devil's Backbone is complex for it genre balancing all it subject matter into a strong and focus film. The Devil's Backbone is easily one of best horror movie you could ever see offering more than any simple horror film.</p></div>

          <div class='comment'><p>A stylish ghost story from Del Toro set during the Spanish Civil War. Unlike 'Pan's Labyrinth' there is no fantasy here but the story of a few children and their teachers in an isolated orphanage/school is classic spooky story set-up (even in the bright Spanish sun). Like 'The Orphanage' the evil in the building doesn't actually resonate from the ghost and when deaths start occuring Del Toro isn't afraid to show the sheer brutality of greed and evil. The film looks beautiful and the performances are excellent (especially from the children). It's a shame Del Toro couldn't have tackled the children's story 'The Hobbit' as this, 'Pan's Labyrinth' and 'The Orphanage' show how excellently he can blend the innocennce of childhood fantasy and naivety with gritty reality.</p></div>
